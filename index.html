        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I enjoy getting things done. Problem-solving is one of my greatest passions,
            as well as being with my family. It's difficult for me not to leap to the aid of someone when they say 
            "I don't get it," "Why doesn't this work?" or "Can you figure this out?"<br><br>
            After teaching math for five years at a public middle school, I had an idea for an app that would help students learn the basics of algebra. 
            I taught myself enough to make a functioning prototype, discovered I enjoyed coding, and now coding is my career. <br><br>
            I love to create and build things. And if you want to discuss a fantasy or sci-fi novel that you've read recently, I'm your guy!
        </p>

                    This app is designed to help students learn the basics of algebra through trial and error.<br><br>
                    Students can either build their own equations or get a randomly generated equation to solve. 
                    The JavaScript file handles all math as well as the placement of new constants and coefficients. 
                    Students can also request hints as well as see the steps they have taken in their solving process. <br><br>
                    This app was built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Express. The formatting of the equations is handled by MathJax.

                    A streamlined process for fans of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn Adventure Game to create their character<br><br>
                    The app guides users through the character creation process, without needing to consult the actual rulebook for 
                    options or details. Main features include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When assigning stats, the app performs all necessary calculations</li>
                        <li>When prioritizing the character's powers, certain options for the character's race are removed, as per the rulebook</li>
                        <li>Upon completion, the app displays all the character info, ready to be copied down onto a physical character sheet</li>
                    </ul>
                    This app was built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, and Axios.
